## Star Wars Fan Application  
 
## Description

Application which displays a overview of all Star Wars resources by using Star Wars public API (swapi.co/api). 

 
## Final objective

- The user opens your app and gets a login screen. He has to login. After a successful login he is navigated to the overview page. If the user is logged in, he can refresh the browser and has not to login again. 
- The user has a list of all Star Wars resources, where he can filter for resource types (like people, starships...).
- The overview should include a search element, which searches anything in the any resource.
- The user clicks on a resource item and gets a detail view over it.
